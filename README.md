# DID Transport DAO 

DID Transport DAO is an analytics and incident management platform for citizens, police officers, drivers to report and manage incidents, detect and prevent accidents on web, mobile in a secure and simplified manner.

Features:

- 360 degrees access: Command and control centers can manage the complete lifecycle of incident reporting, overall status, enable early stage prevention of accidents and road safety counseling, management of workforce at the incident site.

- Real Time Analytics, alerts, streaming: Analytics of the incidents with sentiment analysis, live incident reporting. road safety eco-system. Health summary of the police staff, scheduling the staff. Reducing misinformation.

- Decentralized twitter like chat app for emergency help & care.

- Incident Dashboard: Manage and track your incidents as a citizen along with sharing reviews and comments. Incident reporting, severity analytics and sentiment analysis using social media data for early stage detection and prevention of incidents.


Goal: Effective design, engineering, and delivery of blockchain technology-aided solutions for vehicles and citizens to make roads safer and better for everyone using predictive analytics and automation using Onyx, Biconomy, zksync Era Blockchain, Lens Protocol and Magic SDK. Tracking transport securely, transparently and cost effectively using Web3 Digital Identity eco-system tools.

Digital Identity Web3 tools to manage and enable connected vehicles for efficiency and sustainability, reduce fleet incidents, road accidents.  

Digital Identity Personas: The technical solution demonstrates capabilities which are pluggable, extendable to 4 different personas: Citizen, Police Officer, Dispatcher, Administrator

1. Citizen: → Ability to create SOS: incident created automatically, added to ICM (Investigative Case management)

→ Create incident: Can directly create an incident/ticket on different categories.

→ Track the status of the incident (in progress/complete)/navigate to details of the same.

→ Provide feedback/view happiness review on the same.

The citizen functionalities are also made available on the mobile, which can provide live interactivity.

2. Police officer: A police officer can view incidents to which s/he is assigned. the ones new, in progress and can also
upload evidence to close the same. S/he can view the same on the map and click on details to navigate further, view details, add
details. All of this will be recorded in central investigative case management system.

3. Dispatcher (assigning cases): Video analytics brings in capabilities of what you could understand form the vehicles/license plates and identify suspicious object/issues.

4. Administrator /police head: As an administrator, the police head could get complete overview of :

• Analytics of the police force, citizens

• Analytics of the incidents

• Understand social media trends.

• Health summary of the police officer

 # DID, TBD, Lens and Biconomy integration, Polygon ID, Web3 ecosystem tools

Spare Parts Lens is a Social graph for Defi. It will take user's transactions, trades, positions or any defi activity on the spare parts Defi marketplace. And Suggests users to put on social graph lens.

Once transaction on lens, It will be available to everyone as a POST. POST like social post. Biconomy SDK used for perform batch txs to post data on Lens. 

By making available to everyone:

- Other users can discuss on that transaction/post.
- Other users can copy that spare parts trade and create same spare parts trade for them. and post will available for them too.
- Many more mobility and vehicle service usecases can be made by making defi open discussion platform.
- We can create awareness about defi by showing post in a way so new web3 users can learn from it.

Lens Protocol and Neume: We are using Lens and neume recording audio based incidents where video is not possible to record. This will enable us to develop a socially scalable and open-source metadata retrieval, indexing, and management infrastructure for decentralized road incident management. Bandwidth is a major issue in India and neume protocol fits right at the spot for quick data retrieval where video is not possible due to high latency or unavailability of network for video streaming.

# zksync Era and TBD, DID Web3 ecosystem tools

- DID and zksync Paymasters: Giving free transactions to citizen developers, journalists, volunteers sharing anonymized report or incident data. This improves better outcomes for monitoring, incident reporting, precision logistics. We wish to enable 0 transaction fees for volunteers sharing anonymized report data using PyTorch or Scikit libraries.

-DID and zksync Era Wallet dapp for for handling toll ticket payments for vehicles and maintenance/service payments on top of expenses claimed for getting the requisite driving licenses. It is our go to wallet for handling interstate payments and third party payments like payments to government license regulators, repair providers: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/De-Transport-Monitor/tree/main/zksync-Web3-Modules

We also plan to integrate QuickSwap with wallet to ensure that the vehicle owners or drivers can swap the tokens if needed at the time of service/repair or even getting license from regulators.

- DAOs tracker tool for road incident management: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/De-Transport-Monitor/tree/main/electronicincidentmanagement

- Account Abstraction plugins for DID Transport DAO using zksync Era: Account Abstraction Plugins for Transport DAO enables customization of verification logic via plugins with a rule/logic setting, tabulation, organization, visualization tool namely SocialCalc spreadsheet. This allows users to set up rules which their account has to abide by when executing transactions while being able to reconfigure them in the future. The process improves account security by restricting permissions certain keys have while remaining adaptable to the user's changing needs.

  Please visit Demo 1 and 4 at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/12pzP2fGs5B8tYVtn2qojLHSUREPPCaqV

Implementation areas of Account Abstraction plugins in Onyx Transport DAO: 

Enforcing a spending limit for vital transport assets based on the key used for the transaction.

Restricting interaction with a certain citizen wallet or DAO dApp to a specific key.

Defining session keys, which are allowed to initiate service or repair transactions for only a limited period of time.

 
# DID wallet and Visa Payments Integration and Web3 ecosystem tools

We are bootstrapping Visa payments implementation in Typescript to connect with our ionic apps which uses typescript as the core for handling application logic. We also wish to use Visa as the Web3 payments cloud computing provider.

# DID Transport DAO: Blockchain and Web3 ecosystem tools enabled user security, payments and on-chain analytics

DID, TBD, Ontology, Trinsic and PolygonID; Biconomy, zksync Era Smart Contracts, Lens Protocol and Magic SDK: We are using Onyx, Biconomy, zksync Era Smart Contracts, Lens Protocol and Magic SDK for solving multiple challenges in investigative case management of road incidents for the admin role: sentiment analysis of a particular road incident for the admin role, social media text mining for a road incident and classification and severity of the incidents, early-stage incident response and prevention.

zksync Paymasters, TBD and Biconomy SDK enable us to have a DAO infrastructure with minimal gas fees. That is very important both from the privacy and cost-effectiveness front. 

Offchain interoperability with Ethereum-like blockchains. Also, the ability to use decentralized NFT voting for incident investigative systems.

Ability to generate NFT and ease of identity management.

We are generating an NFT for NFC tags for vehicles and spare parts at the time of service and repair workflows.

Identity management, the ability to extend the solution, and reducing misinformation at the time of Incident analysis and reporting.

TBD analytics and aggregator tooling: investigative case management and incident reporting, identity management at the time of allocation of a case to a police officer, and incident severity analysis based on the decentralized voting at the Onyx blockchain.
