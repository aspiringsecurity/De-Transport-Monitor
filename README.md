# Onyx Transport DAO 

Effective design, engineering, and delivery of blockchain technology-aided solutions for vehicles and citizens to make roads safer and better for everyone using predictive analytics and automation using Onyx, Biconomy, zksync Era Blockchain, Lens Protocol and Magic SDK.


Onyx, Biconomy, zksync Era Smart Contracts, Lens Protocol and Magic SDK: We are using Onyx, Biconomy, zksync Era Smart Contracts, Lens Protocol and Magic SDK for solving multiple challenges in investigative case management of road incidents for the admin role: sentiment analysis of a particular road incident for the admin role, social media text mining for a road incident and classification and severity of the incidents, early-stage incident response and prevention.

zksync Paymasters, Onyx and Biconomy SDK enable us to have a DAO infrastructure with minimal gas fees. That is very important both from the privacy and cost-effectiveness front.

Offchain interoperability with Ethereum-like blockchains. Also, the ability to use decentralized NFT voting for incident investigative systems.

Ability to generate NFT and ease of identity management.

We are generating an NFT for NFC tags for vehicles and spare parts at the time of service and repair workflows.

Identity management, the ability to extend the solution using IBC, and reducing misinformation at the time of Incident analysis and reporting are the key reasons for experimenting with Waves.

Onyx analytics and aggregator tooling: investigative case management and incident reporting, identity management at the time of allocation of a case to a police officer, and incident severity analysis based on the decentralized voting at the Onyx blockchain.
