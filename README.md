# Onyx Transport DAO 

Effective design, engineering, and delivery of blockchain technology-aided solutions for vehicles and citizens to make roads safer and better for everyone using predictive analytics and automation using Onyx, Biconomy, zksync Era Blockchain, Lens Protocol and Magic SDK.


Onyx, Biconomy, zksync Era Smart Contracts, Lens Protocol and Magic SDK: We are using Onyx, Biconomy, zksync Era Smart Contracts, Lens Protocol and Magic SDK for solving multiple challenges in investigative case management of road incidents for the admin role: sentiment analysis of a particular road incident for the admin role, social media text mining for a road incident and classification and severity of the incidents, early-stage incident response and prevention.

zksync Paymasters, Onyx and Biconomy SDK enable us to have a DAO infrastructure with minimal gas fees. That is very important both from the privacy and cost-effectiveness front.

Offchain interoperability with Ethereum-like blockchains. Also, the ability to use decentralized NFT voting for incident investigative systems.

Ability to generate NFT and ease of identity management.

We are generating an NFT for NFC tags for vehicles and spare parts at the time of service and repair workflows.

Identity management, the ability to extend the solution using IBC, and reducing misinformation at the time of Incident analysis and reporting are the key reasons for experimenting with Waves.

Onyx analytics and aggregator tooling: investigative case management and incident reporting, identity management at the time of allocation of a case to a police officer, and incident severity analysis based on the decentralized voting at the Onyx blockchain.

 # Lens and Biconomy integration, Web3 ecosystem tools

Spare Parts Lens is a Social graph for Defi. It will take user's transactions, trades, positions or any defi activity on the spare parts Defi marketplace. And Suggests users to put on social graph lens.

Once transaction on lens, It will be available to everyone as a POST. POST like social post. Biconomy SDK used for perform batch txs to post data on Lens. 

By making available to everyone:

- Other users can discuss on that transaction/post.
- Other users can copy that spare parts trade and create same spare parts trade for them. and post will available for them too.
- Many more mobility and vehicle service usecases can be made by making defi open discussion platform.
- We can create awareness about defi by showing post in a way so new web3 users can learn from it.
